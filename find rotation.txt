Suppose you want to find a rotation matrix RR that rotates unit vector aa onto unit vector bb.

Proceed as follows:

Let v=a×bv=a×b
Let s=||v|| (sine of angle)

Let c=a·bc=a·b (cosine of angle)

Then the rotation matrix R is given by:
R=I+[v]×+[v]2×1-cs2,
R=I+[v]×+[v]×21-cs2,
where [v]×[v]× is the skew-symmetric cross-product matrix of vv,
[v]×=def???0v3-v2-v30v1v2-v10???.
